Transfer Time vs. File Size

Setup:
- Client/server communication via named pipes (FIFOs) with a default buffer capacity of 256 bytes.
- Tested files: 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 MB (truncated in BIMDC/).

Results (File Size in MB, Transfer Time in seconds):
MB, seconds
1, 0.462
5, 1.100
10, 1.853
20, 3.795
50, 8.076
100, 15.516

Observations:
- Transfer time scales approximately linearly with file size, following an initial small startup overhead.
- Using larger buffers (e.g., with -m 4096) reduces the number of round trips, thereby improving throughput. However, the performance gains diminish once FIFO bandwidth limits and syscall/memcpy overhead become dominant.

Explanation:
- Each data chunk involves a request/response cycle over FIFOs, file reading, and user/kernel memory copies.
- The model for transfer time is: time â‰ˆ constant_overhead + (bytes / effective_throughput), resulting in a near-linear relationship.
